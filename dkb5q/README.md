## Das Keyboard 5Q

This is an **abandoned**, unfinished and untested implementation of the *Das
Keyboard 5Q* wire protocol in Go. It was written because I hoped to tweak the
code to support the *Das Keyboard 4Q*. Unfortunately it turned out that the
4Q's wire protocol is completely different.

Anybody interested in picking this up, send me a note and I'll happily add you
to the repository :)
